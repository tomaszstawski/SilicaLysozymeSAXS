# SilicaLysozymeSAXS

WHAT IS THIS FOR?
This repository constitutes a part of the Supplementary Material for our publication "Mechanism of formation of silica-lysozyme composites through the protein-mediated aggregation followed by in situ fast SAXS" (in preparation). It contains routines in GNU Octave/Matlab used to processes SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) patterns. We used the scripts to perform fits and analyze data obtained during the experiment at the BioSAXS beamline P12 of the EMBL at PETRA III (DESY, Germany).

HOW TO USE?
The script was written and tested in GNU Octave >4. It should also work in Matlab. The following packages has to be also installed: NAN, OPTIM.
