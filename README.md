# SilicaLysozymeSAXS

WHAT IS THIS FOR?
This repository constitutes a part of the Supplementary Material for our publication "Mechanism of formation of silica-lysozyme composites through the protein-mediated aggregation followed by in situ fast SAXS" (in preparation). It contains routines in GNU Octave/Matlab used to processes SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) patterns. We used the scripts to perform fits and analyze data obtained during the experiment at the BioSAXS beamline P12 of the EMBL at PETRA III (DESY, Germany).
